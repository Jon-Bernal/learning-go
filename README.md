## Installing and using packages

To make a binary file run:
$ go build
$ go install

You can also just run go install if you want to build and install and are not doing anything with the file other than installing it.

To work with something you actually want to run on your system, the binary needs to be in /home/<user>/go/bin
The install script only works if you develop your code inside of a directory in /home/<user>/go/src/<project name>
or if it is a system wide install and not scoped to the user, it will be in root/go/src
